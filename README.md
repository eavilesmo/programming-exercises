# Define a card suit
You get any card as an argument. Your task is to return the suit of this card (in lowercase).

('3♣') -> return 'clubs'
('3♦') -> return 'diamonds'
('3♥') -> return 'hearts'
('3♠') -> return 'spades'

# Plural
We need a simple function that determines if a plural is needed or not. It should take a number, and return true if a plural should be used with that number or false if not. This would be useful when printing out a string such as 5 minutes, 14 apples, or 1 sun.
You only need to worry about english grammar rules for this kata, where anything that isn't singular (one of something), it is plural (not one of something).
All values will be positive integers or floats, or zero.

# Find Mean 
Find the mean (average) of a list of numbers in an array.
To find the mean (average) of a set of numbers add all the numbers together and divide by the number of values in the list.

For an example list of 1, 3, 5, 7

1. Add all the numbers

1+3+5+7 = 16
2. Divide by the number of values in the list. In this example there are 4 numbers in the list.

16/4 = 4
3. The mean (or average) of this list is 4
